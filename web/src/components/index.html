  <h1>The Global Digital Rights Charter</h1>
  <div class="text-subheading pt-3">VERSION 1.0 - MARCH 2023</div>
</div>
<div class="pt-4">
  <h2>Preamble</h2>
  <p>These truths are self-evident:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      the digital realm, consisting of computers, mobile phones, the internet,
      augmented and virtual reality, the metaverse and other related
      technologies, is a permanent and important part of human society.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      people are endowed with certain inalienable rights that apply in the
      digital realm, just as they apply in the physical realm.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      people have the right to live their lives in the digital realm, with the
      same freedom, dignity, and personal sovereignty as in the physical realm.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      rights in the digital realm shall not be abridged without due process of
      law. Any abridgment of digital rights must further a compelling government
      interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.
    </li>
  </ul>

<div class="pt-3">
  <h2>The Digital Rights</h2>
  <ol>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in
      the digital realm.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone has the right to own, and hold in their own direct and exclusive
      possession and control, digital objects, without unreasonable burdens. The
      government shall not have the right to store or access passwords or
      private keys without due process of law. All other legal or natural
      persons shall not have the right to store or access passwords or private
      keys without explicit permission.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone has the right to be free to transact digital objects, without
      unreasonable burdens.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone has the right to use decentralized applications, without
      unreasonable burdens.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and
      seizures of their digital objects and no warrants shall issue, but upon
      probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly
      describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be
      seized. This right extends to digital objects and information a person
      provides to a third party, whether intentionally or unintentionally. The
      government may not search or seize such digital objects or information
      without complying with the requirements of the foregoing sentence.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone has the right to participate in the creation and maintenance of
      digital public commons, such as open-source software and public
      blockchains and distributed ledgers. No one shall be held responsible for
      the actions of others in a digital public commons that is not under that
      person's control.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone has the right to privacy in their digital life. The right to
      privacy also includes the right of everyone to use encryption that is free
      from back doors or other intentional weaknesses or circumventions in the
      encryption that are accessible by the government or private companies or
      individuals. Interpretations of this right should be read broadly and to
      favor an individual's right to privacy.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone has the right to be treated in a non-discriminatory manner
      regardless of sex, race, color, ethnic or social origin, genetic features,
      language, religion or other belief, political opinion, membership of a
      national minority, property, birth, disability, age, gender or sexual
      orientation.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone has the right to exit from any digital service by claiming their
      personal digital data. Digital services that utilize data held on a public
      blockchain are presumed compliant with this clause. Digital services that
      hold data in a private database must make such data available for export
      in common formats, in reasonable timeframes, using reasonable methods.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone in the digital realm has the right to speak, assemble, practice
      their religion, conduct scientific and academic research, and petition the
      government.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone has the right to define contractual rights in the digital realm
      and allow exercise of those rights in a personal or automated manner.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone is free from collective punishment in the digital realm.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone has the right to act in the digital realm through anonymous
      identities, pseudonymous identities and/or software agents, so long as
      each person maintains personal responsibility for the actions of all their
      identities and agents.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      The rights enumerated above cannot be abridged, except when narrowly
      tailored to further a legitimate and compelling government interest and
      after due process of law. In any proceeding to abridge the rights
      enumerated above, the defendant shall have the right to legal
      representation and shall enjoy the presumption of innocence. National
      security exceptions to the above should be time- and scope-limited and
      supervised by a competent court with a presumption that hearings should be
      public. In no case should national security exemptions be applied to
      collective societal restrictions of digital rights.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2 mb-2">
      Everyone has the obligation to comply with the relevant laws and
      regulations of their respective state and community, in a manner
      consistent with the rights enumerated above, and to respect the rights of
      others to conduct their digital lives peacefully.
    </li>
