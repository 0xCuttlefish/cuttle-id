              </p>
              <p class="question-answer">
                Digital spaces (realms) are now the default professional and
                social spaces in developed economies.
                <br />
                <br />
                In 2023, we work, play, socialize, advocate, communicate,
                transact, earn a living, express our political and social views,
                fall in love and marry, and keep in touch with our families,
                primarily in the digital realm.
                <br />
                <br />
                For better or for worse, almost every digital service is run by
                a company, so the default “rights” models (and norms) in the
                digital realm are that of a “customer”, not that of a “citizen.”
                This means that even though, in theory, our existing
                constitutional rights apply in the digital realm, in practice,
                given the high level of corporatization of the digital realm, we
                have vastly fewer rights in the digital realm than in the
                physical realm.
                <br />
                <br />
                There is also some level of tension between the state /
                corporations and certain digital public commons. This tension
                existed in the 1990s with open-source software and exists today
                with public blockchains (cryptocurrencies). We believe there
                should be no tension - digital public commons are good for
                everyone and good for society, and are broadly within the
                democratic tradition of a constitutional democracy.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our view is that public spaces, public commons, and private
                spaces should exist in the digital realm as they do in the
                physical realm, and the state should protect and encourage those
                spaces. In the physical world, you are allowed to own a home,
                own a piece of art, walk on a public beach, public park or
                public street and, in all cases, your rights to do so cannot be
                abridged without the important due process protections that
                modern democracies offer. By contrast, you have significantly
                fewer rights in a private shopping mall or in a private office
                building (the owner can ask you to leave).
                <br />
                <br />
                Right now the digital realm primarily consists of the equivalent
                of private shopping malls. We have no objection to shopping
                malls, but it is important that you can also own a piece of art
                privately, have a private conversation in your home or share a
                public park with others in the digital realm as well.
                <br />
                <br />
                The GDRC is not an anti-government or anti-corporate statement,
                it is a pro-human rights, pro-democracy, pro-society,
                pro-private ownership, pro-humanity statement. Every one of us
                is firstly a citizen and secondarily a “consumer” or “user.”
                Right now, the balance in the digital realm is far too weighted
                towards the latter.
                <br />
                <br />
                To put it simply, we believe that the traditional rights of a
                constitutional democracy (speech, privacy, ownership, due
                process and so on), should exist, not just in theory, but in
                practice in the digital realm.

              </p>
              <p class="question-answer">
                The goal of the GDRC 1 is not to propose detailed laws and
                regulations. Subsequent GDRC community activities could include
                adapting it for specific legal or regulatory matters.

              <p class="question-answer">
                So do we. We believe laws are best developed within a framework
                of constitutional rights, in a similar manner to most modern
                democracies.

              </p>
              <p class="question-answer">
                GDRC 1 is primarily about preserving public commons and their
                associated norms in the digital realm. In the digital realm,
                those public commons include open internet protocols such as
                email, open-source software such as Linux, open file formats
                such as PDFs and public blockchains (often called
                cryptocurrencies).
                <br />
                <br />
                We believe that digital public commons should be clearly legal
                and, in the ideal case, actively encouraged by society and the
                state for the same reason that we retain personal and public
                spaces in the physical realm.
                <br />
                <br />
                We also believe that there should be general principles
                governing the relative rights and responsibilities of citizens,
                companies, and the state in the digital realm.

                Great! This may be true. You can fork the GDRC 1 on our github
